        rock was Chuck Berry. He paved the way for many other artist to come
        with his fast guitar riffs and upbeat songs. He revolutionized the style
        for songs and provided influence for many future bands to come. Next was

        Elvis took heavy inspration from Chuck Berry's music and others like
        him. With hits like 'Hound Dog' and 'Jailhouse Rock', he quickly rose to
        the top in the US. His music was less heavy and had more of a "happy go
        lucky" feeling to it. He set the stage and the standard for live music
        for decades to come.

        In the Uk, The Beatles had just come out with their First album, Please
        Please Me, and everyone loved it. The Fab four quickly rose to rival
        Elvis and other group-breaking artist from their time. Towards the end
        of the 60's, there was an explosion of bands from the Uk, US, and
        Canada. These included led Zepplin, The Rolling Stones, Queen, Lynard
        Skynard, Bruce Springsteen, The Guess Who, The Who, April Wine, AC/DC,

        The 80's brought the intro of disco music and punk rock, which greatly
        influenced some of the rock'n'roll artists of the time. Songs became
        more upbeat and heavy instraments became more advanced with new ways to
        play them.
