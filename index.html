        Hello, All! This is a website made by your very own, for your enjoyment!
        Today I'll be talking about my favourite kind of music, Rock'n'Roll. The
        reason I love rock'n'roll is because of the talent held by the artists.
        Nowadays, music can be made by random, everyday people with absolutly no
        talent. Take a look at what music has evolved into verses music from the
        70s. Back then, the artists needed to have experience with the
        instrament and talent. Now im not saying ALL the new artists don't have
        talent, some of them are actually really talented and put in the work.
        But then there are some who use auto-tune and a computer to simulate
        sounds and are only in the music buisness for the money, not the music.
